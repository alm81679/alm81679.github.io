<td>The Brittany Spaniel is an amazing dog! Sometimes their name gets shortened to just "Brittany." 
Brittany Spaniel's are extremely intelligent. 
They are known as one of the best breeds of hunting dogs to ever live. They are able to track down birds, deer, and turkey for their hunting owners due to their outstanding sense of smell. 
 
 Their coat is beautiful. The most common coat pattern is white with golden/brownish spots, however, it can also be white with black spots.
 </td>
<td>For the most part Brittany's are medium sized dogs. 
 At full grown they can get up to forty pounds and about one foot, eight inches tall. 
 Brittany Spaniel's have a pretty long lifespan, living up to 13 years.
 In saying that, just like the Labrador, they can also be prone to hip problems. These problems are very treatable especially in the early stages.
 Due to their short hair, it is very easy to groom Brittany Spaniels. They require little effort to make them look beautiful.
 In order to have a healthy Brittany Spaniel, one must keep him/her on an appropriate diet, this means keeping table scraps to a minimum. </td>
<td>If you are looking for a great family dog then the Brittany Spaniel is the breed for you! 
The Brittany Spaniel is amazing with children because they are so loving and careful.
 They are also great with other dogs and pets. They are full of energy though! Brittany Spaniel's love attention and they require several playtimes throughout the day.  </td>
